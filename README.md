# 🍽️ Naija Tastes Restaurant Sales Analysis  
## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes four months (November–February) of restaurant sales data for Naija Tastes, a local Nigerian eatery. The goal is to explore customer demographics, identify top-performing products, and uncover sales trends to support smarter business decisions.  

The data was cleaned and prepared using PostgreSQL, transformed in Power Query, and visualized in Power BI. The entire process aims to empower the restaurant with actionable insights to optimize menu performance, streamline operations, and better understand its customers.  

## 🧹 Data Cleaning and Preparation  
### Tools Used:  
PostgreSQL via pgAdmin4  

### Datasets:  
<a href = "/files\customers.csv">Customers.csv</a>  
<a href = "files\products.csv">products.csv</a>  
<a href = "files\sales.csv">Sales.csv</a>  

### Steps taken:  
Created my table and imported the datasets into PostgreSQL.  
Validated data structure against table definitions (customers, products, and sales)  

**Checked for and confirmed:**  
✅ No null primary keys  
✅ No duplicate email addresses or product IDs  
✅ No negative quantities or prices  

**Verified integrity by comparing:**  
total_price = quantity × price  
Preserved same-day purchases from customers as valid (not treated as duplicates)

## 📉 Key Insights  
**High Concentration of Revenue from a Few Customers:**  
Customers with IDs 2, 25, 4, 53, and 63 contributed over ₦240k collectively. These high-value customers represent a core audience that should be retained with loyalty offers or VIP treatment.  

**Weekday Dominance with Weekend Peaks:**  
While weekdays account for most transactions, Saturdays dominate single-day revenue. This pattern suggests a mix of daily regulars and weekend splurges.  

**25–34 Year Olds are the Spending Core:**  
This age group leads in both frequency and revenue contribution, making them ideal for targeted upselling and personalized marketing.  

**Ikeja, VI, and Lekki are Core Markets:**  
These locations combine for nearly 70 customers, indicating regional clusters that could support localized advertising or delivery expansion.  

**Suya & Amala Rule the Menu:**  
The top 3 dishes bring in nearly ₦1M of total revenue. These are not just best-sellers but brand-defining items.  

**Digital Payments are Dominant:**  
With over 68% of payments via transfer or POS, cashless infrastructure should be a top operational priority.  

## ✅ Recommendations  
**Introduce a Loyalty Program for Top Spenders:**  
Target the highest-value customers with exclusive deals or early access to new menu items.  

**Bundle Promotions on Weekends:**  
Create combo offers (e.g., Suya + Palm Wine + Chapman) to increase average ticket size, especially for weekend diners.  

**Deploy Delivery Services in Top Locations:**  
Focus on Ikeja, VI, and Lekki through partnerships with delivery platforms or own dispatch teams.  

**Launch Campaigns for the 25–34 Demographic:**  
Use Instagram and WhatsApp to promote events, discount codes, and offers catered to this segment.  

**Enhance POS and Transfer Checkout:**  
Install more terminals and automate transfer confirmations to minimize delay during peak hours.  

**Repackage Underperformers:**  
Bundle slow-moving drinks (Zobo, Chapman) with best-sellers or offer them at a discount with meals to boost movement.  

**Smart Staffing by Day:**  
Increase kitchen and wait staff on Thursdays and Saturdays; reduce weekday lunch crew where demand is lower.
